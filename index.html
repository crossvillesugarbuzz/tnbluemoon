<h5 id="mom-the-instigator">Mom, the Instigator&hellip;</h5>
<p>Most of the ideas start with her.  She starts by asking the simple, innocent questions that usually end up with someone suddenly finding themselves with a metaphorical or literal paintbrush in thier hand.  She is certainly the instigator.  Isn&rsquo;t it so much fun when she has a new idea?</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="dad-the-backbone">Dad, the Backbone&hellip;</h5>
<p>How hard is it to dig a pond?  How many staples are in the average chair holding the upholstery on?  Can you get that out of the oven?  All of these were questions Dad didn&rsquo;t have the answer to at one point, but he learned them pretty quickly.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="eldest-son-the-machine-whisperer">Eldest Son, the Machine Whisperer&hellip;</h5>
<p>From setting up airbrushes for cookie decorating, to figuring out how to turn a drawing into a cookie cutter, the eldest son makes machines do the work for him.  Being the first born, he knows that things tend to roll down hill.  The machines and computers he works with don&rsquo;t complain at being the bottom of the pile.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="the-middle-child-the-partner-in-crime">The Middle Child, The Partner in Crime&hellip;</h5>
<p>The only daughter, and as such she takes a special place in things.  She has a keen eye for detail and a deep distaste for the mayhem.  Someone has to keep these misfits organized and on task, and she gets to be Mom&rsquo;s enabler.  If mom asks one of those questions, the middle child thinks it would be good idea if one of us answers it.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="the-youngest-son-the-best-helper">The Youngest Son, The Best Helper&hellip;</h5>
<p>Is dad swinging a hammer?  Someone should make sure he doesn&rsquo;t hurt himself.  Is older brother juggling power tools?  Someone should dial a nine and a one and wait to see if something bad happens.  But how does this taste?  Someone needs to try the cookies, and that job falls to the youngest son.  It&rsquo;s a difficult job, but someone has to do it.</p>
